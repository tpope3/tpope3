- 👋 Hi, I’m @tpope3
- 👀 I’m interested in sports, cars, and motorcycles :)
- I played basketball in college at WVWC on a partial scholarship --> https://wesleyanbobcats.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/tommie-pope/6000
- I've worked as a mechanic and a general contractor to put myself through college and graduated with my degree in CompSci in May '22.
- I made it through school but always prioritized life (mainly working) over really focusing on building programming skills. So I hate to say it, but I'm playing catch up a little. 
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing myself on python and java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interrsting 
- 📫 How to reach me email: liltommiepope@gmail.com
